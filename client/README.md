## Build

Use the following command to build the artifact.

```
mvn clean install
```

The artifact is an OSGI bundle with coordinates

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.sling</groupId>
	<artifactId>org.apache.sling.etcd.client</artifactId>
	<version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

## API

The service class is ``EtcdClient`` for which the factory ``EtcdClientFactory`` allows to obtain an instance as shown in the snipnet below.

```
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom().build();
URI etcdEndpoint = new URI("localhost:4001");
EtcdClient etcdClient = EtcdClientFactory#create(httpClient, etcdEndpoint);

// get keys recursively under '/some/key'
String key = "/some/key";
Map<String, String> params = EtcdParams
    .builder()
    .recursive(true)
    .build(); 
EtcdResponse response = etcdClient.getKey(key, params);
if (response.isAction())Â {
	// received an etcd action
	EtcdAction action = response.action();
	// do something with it ..
} else {
    // received an etcd error (I/O errors throw IOException)
    EtcdError error = response.error();
    // handle the error ..
}

```

## Setup
